## 🌍 Live TV Channels Database

If you want to use the curated, lightweight IPTV channel database (containing 6800+ channels) in another project, media player, or Android TV, you can fetch the raw files directly:

- **JSON Format**:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thewiztanvir/LoopinLive/refs/heads/main/app/data/channels.json
  ```

- **M3U Playlist Format** (For Android TV, VLC, Kodi, or LoopinLive):
  ```
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thewiztanvir/LoopinLive/refs/heads/main/app/data/channels.m3u
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **License & Credit Notice**: If you use this channel database or stream source list in your own projects, you **must share and display proper credit** to the original developer (**S. SHAJON**) along with a link back to this repository.

## 🛠️ M3U Playlist Converter

If you need the channel database in standard M3U format, you can use the built-in Node.js conversion script.

### Usage

1. **Quick Conversion** (using defaults: all JSON files in `app/data` ➔ corresponding `.m3u` files):
   ```bash
   npm run convert-m3u
   ```
   *Or run it directly:*
   ```bash
   node scripts/json-to-m3u.js
   ```

2. **Custom Paths**:
   If you want to convert a specific JSON database only:
   ```bash
   node scripts/json-to-m3u.js <path-to-input.json> <path-to-output.m3u>
   ```
